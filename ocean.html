    <h3>Ocean</h3>
    
    <body>
        The ocean is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of Earth.<br>
        In English, the term ocean also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which
        the world ocean is conventionally divided.<br> The following names describe five different
        areas of the ocean: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic.<br>
        The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water[8] and is the primary component of Earth's 
        hydrosphere and is thereby essential to life on Earth.<br>
        The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle
        by acting as a huge heat reservoir.<br>
